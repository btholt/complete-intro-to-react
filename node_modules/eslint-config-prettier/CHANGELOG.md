### Version 2.1.1 (2017-05-20)

- No code changes. Just updates to the readme.

### Version 2.1.0 (2017-05-13)

- Added: The [no-tabs] rule (as a [special rule][no-tabs-special]). Thanks to
  Alex Meah (@AlexMeah)!

### Version 2.0.0 (2017-05-07)

- Changed/Improved: The CLI helper tool is now more helpful.

  - The options of special rules are now validated if possible. If a special
    rule is enabled with non-conflicting options, the CLI no longer warns about
    it.
  - If only special rules that cannot be automatically checked are found, the
    CLI no longer exists with a non-zero exit code. Instead, it only warns about
    the rules.

- Changed: The [no-confusing-arrow] is now a special rule again, since it might
  conflict with recent Prettier versions.

- Removed: The `react/wrap-multilines` rule (which has been deprecated for a
  while), since it was removed in eslint-plugin-react@7.

### Version 1.7.0 (2017-04-19)

- Changed: The [no-confusing-arrow] is no longer a special rule, but simply
  turned off, since recent Prettier versions make it redundant.
- Improved: The CLI helper tool now has a more helpful message for special
  rules, and exits with a different status code if only special rules were
  found. The exit codes are now documented as well.

### Version 1.6.0 (2017-04-05)

- Added: The [curly] rule. Thanks to Martin RÃ¤dlinger (@formatlos)!

### Version 1.5.0 (2017-03-04)

- Added: The [nonblock-statement-body-position] rule.

### Version 1.4.1 (2017-02-28)

- Improved: eslint-config-prettier is now part of the [prettier] organization!
  This version updates all URLs to point to the new home of the project.

### Version 1.4.0 (2017-02-26)

- Added: The [no-confusing-arrow] rule (as a
  [special rule][no-confusing-arrow-special]). Thanks to Dominik Ferber
  (@dferber90)!
- Added: Deprecated or removed rules that might conflict with prettier. Thanks
  to Dominik Ferber (@dferber90)!

  (@tibdex)!

  (@0xR)!
