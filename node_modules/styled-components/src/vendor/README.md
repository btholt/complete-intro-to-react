Then hacked things around:

* Deleted `previous-map.js` and all references to it because it `require('fs')`ed
* Deleted reference to `postcss` within `postcss-nested` & simply exported the transform function
* Made `StyleSheet.insert()` return something with an `update()` method
* Replaced nested `require` statements with `import` declarations for the sake of a leaner bundle. This entails adding empty imports to three files to guarantee correct ordering â€“ see https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/100
