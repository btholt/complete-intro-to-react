Utilising [tagged template literals](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals) (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the [power of CSS](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#supported-css), `styled-components` allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles ‚Äì using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!

`styled-components` is compatible with both React (for web) and ReactNative ‚Äì meaning it's the perfect choice even for truly universal apps! See the [documentation about ReactNative](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#react-native) for more information.

## Docs

**See the documentation at [styled-components.com/docs](https://www.styled-components/docs)** for more information about using `styled-components`!

### Quicklinks

- [Tagged Template Literals explained](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals)

## Linting

There is (currently experimental) support for `stylelint` ‚Äì meaning you can take advantage of 150 rules to make sure your `styled-components` CSS is solid!

![Recording of stylelint correctly reporting errors in a styled components' CSS](http://imgur.com/br9zdHb.gif)

See the [`stylelint-processor-styled-components`](https://github.com/styled-components/stylelint-processor-styled-components) repository for installation instructions.

## Syntax highlighting

The one thing you lose when writing CSS in template literals is syntax highlighting. We're working hard on making proper syntax highlighting happening in all editors. We currently have support for Atom, Visual Studio Code, and soon Sublime Text.

This is what it looks like when properly highlighted:

<img alt="Syntax highlighted styled component" src="http://imgur.com/k7h45c3.jpg" height="150px" />

### Atom

[**@gandm**](https://github.com/gandm), the creator of `language-babel`, has added support for `styled-components` in Atom!

To get proper syntax highlighting, all you have to do is install and use the `language-babel` package for your JavaScript files!

### Sublime Text

There is an [open PR](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime/pull/289) by [@garetmckinley](https://github.com/garetmckinley) to add support for `styled-components` to `babel-sublime`! (if you want the PR to land, feel free to üëç the initial comment to let the maintainers know there's a need for this!)

As soon as that PR is merged and a new version released, all you'll have to do is install and use `babel-sublime` to highlight your JavaScript files!

### Visual Studio Code

The [vscode-styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/vscode-styled-components) extension provides syntax highlighting inside your Javascript files. You can install it as usual from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components).

### VIM / NeoVim
The [`vim-styled-components`](https://github.com/fleischie/vim-styled-components) plugin gives you syntax highlighting inside your Javascript files. Install it with your usual plugin manager like [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), etc.

Also if you're looking for an awesome javascript syntax package you can never go wrong with [YAJS.vim](https://github.com/othree/yajs.vim).

### Other Editors

We could use your help to get syntax highlighting support to other editors! If you want to start working on syntax highlighting for your editor, open an issue to let us know.

## Alternative Installation Methods

If you're not using a module bundler or not using `npm` as your package manager, we also have a global ("UMD") build!

You can use that via the `unpkg` CDN to get `styled-components`, the URL is `https://unpkg.com/styled-components/dist/styled-components.min.js`.

To install `styled-components` with bower you'd do:

```
bower install styled-components=https://unpkg.com/styled-components/dist/styled-components.min.js
```

To use it from your HTML, add this at the bottom of your `index.html`, and you'll have access to the global `window.styled` variable:

```HTML
<script src="https://unpkg.com/styled-components/dist/styled-components.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

## Other solutions

If `styled-components` isn't quite what you're looking for, maybe something in this list is:

- [`glamorous`](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous) - basically `styled-components` but using JS objects and functions instead of strings.
