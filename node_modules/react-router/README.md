# react-router

Declarative routing for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save react-router

Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:

```js
// using ES6 modules
import { Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router'

// using CommonJS modules
var Router = require('react-router').Router
var Route = require('react-router').Route
var Switch = require('react-router').Switch
```

The UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-router/umd/react-router.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.ReactRouter`.
