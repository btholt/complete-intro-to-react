## Installation

Installing to this project is quite easy.

Make sure you have node installed and run:

```console
$ npm install
```

Then your most useful command while contributing will be:

```console
$ npm test
```

If you work on a bug it's recommended to write a test that replicates your issue and work on your fix, making sure you don't break other tests.

## You don't know how to make a PR?

You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) by [@kentcdodds](https://kentcdodds.com/).

## What to work on?

If you want to make an improvement to the library, please [open an issue first](https://github.com/adriantoine/enzyme-to-json/issues). If you want to fix something, I'd prefer if you open an issue first but I'm quite open, as long as you provide a test for your fix and don't break existing tests.

If you just want to contribute, [open the list of issues](https://github.com/adriantoine/enzyme-to-json/issues) and pick one to investigate.
